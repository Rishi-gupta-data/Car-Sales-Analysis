Project Name: Car Sales Analysis and Reporting Tool

1. Introduction
---------------
This document specifies the requirements for the Car Sales Analysis and Reporting Tool. The system provides a comprehensive interface for analyzing and visualizing car sales data, offering statistical summaries and detailed reports based on the provided dataset.

1.1 Purpose
-----------
The purpose of this software is to assist users in gaining insights from a car sales dataset through interactive visualizations and statistical information. The tool aims to simplify data analysis and present information in a user-friendly manner.

1.2 Scope
---------
The Car Sales Analysis and Reporting Tool will:
- Read and process car sales data from a CSV file.
- Provide an interactive menu-driven interface for users to select analysis options.
- Generate various visualizations and display statistical information.
- Handle invalid inputs and guide the user throughout the process.
- Be implemented using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
--------------------------------------------
- CSV: Comma-Separated Values
- DataFrame: A two-dimensional, tabular data structure provided by pandas.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of data, such as bar plots and pie charts.

2. Overall Description
----------------------
2.1 Product Perspective
-----------------------
The software will act as a standalone application designed to run on a local machine. It will provide an interactive command-line interface for users to navigate and perform data analysis tasks.

2.2 Product Features
--------------------
1. Data Import and Reading
   - Import a car sales dataset from a CSV file using the pandas library.

2. User Menu Options
   - An interactive menu will allow users to:
     1. View visualizations
     2. Get statistical information
     3. Exit the program

3. Visualizations
   - Option to generate various visualizations, including:
     1. Sales price variation across car models
     2. Distribution of units sold across car models
     3. Manufacturer total sales
     4. Sales price distribution by manufacturing year
     5. Trends in units sold over time
     6. Outliers in sales price and units sold
     7. Correlation between sales price and units sold
     8. Sales revenue variation across car models
     9. Market share of manufacturers
     10. Seasonal patterns in car sales

4. Statistical Information
   - Option to view statistical summaries, such as:
     1. Total units sold for all car models
     2. Car model with the highest sales price
     3. Car model with the lowest sales price
     4. Average sales price of all car models
     5. Average number of units sold for all car models

5. Input Validation
   - The system will handle incorrect inputs gracefully, prompting the user to enter valid choices.

6. Exiting the Program
   - A clean and friendly exit option will be provided.

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
------------------------------------
- Analysts: Users who want to explore sales data through visualizations.
- Sales Teams: Users interested in gaining insights into market trends and sales performance.
- Business Executives: Users looking for high-level summaries and statistics for decision-making.

2.4 Operating Environment
-------------------------
- Platform: Local machine with Python 3.x installed
- Libraries Required: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

3. Specific Requirements
------------------------
3.1 Functional Requirements
---------------------------
1. Data Import Functionality
   - The software shall read the car sales dataset from a specified CSV file.
   - The software shall store the imported data in a pandas DataFrame.

2. Interactive User Menu
   - The software shall display a menu with three options: View visualizations, Get statistical information, and Exit.
   - The software shall handle invalid menu choices and prompt the user to try again.

3. Visualization Options
   - The software shall provide ten types of visualizations.
   - Each visualization shall be generated using the matplotlib library.

4. Statistical Information Options
   - The software shall provide five statistical summaries.
   - Each summary shall be displayed in a clear and understandable format.

5. Error Handling
   - The software shall display error messages for invalid inputs and guide the user to enter correct options.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
-------------------------------
1. Usability
   - The software shall provide a simple and intuitive interface for non-technical users.
2. Performance
   - The software shall process and display results within a few seconds for datasets of up to 10,000 records.
3. Scalability
   - The system shall be designed to handle larger datasets with minimal performance degradation.
4. Maintainability
   - The code shall be well-documented to facilitate future updates and modifications.

3.3 System Interfaces
---------------------
- File Input: The system will read from a CSV file named "car.csv."
- User Interface: Command-line interface (CLI) for selecting options and viewing results.

4. Design Constraints
---------------------
- Python Version: The software must be compatible with Python 3.7 or higher.
- Libraries: The software will use pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for visualizations.
